BABY CASSIDY TIMELINE PROJECT!

//INTRO
Hello!
This project was created as my final/capstone for Code Louisville FEWD (January 2019 Session)

//SUMMARY
This project is a digital journal to document my pregnancy with my first child (due in June!)
I wanted a way to share big news with only people who cared, instead of ALL of my Facebook friends.
There is an entry page, only accessible by the author (with password) as well as the timeline page, accessible by anyone who has the public side password.
To access the entry page, use password "mommy"
To access the timeline page, use password "friendsandfam"
